You can add `.php` files to this directory to load classes and functions defined
in them at runtime.

Any such files are loaded automatically and unconditionally, without the need
to `arc liberate` first to update a library map. You can also extend Phorge by
creating a separate library, storing it somewhere else, and adding it to the
`load-libraries` key in configuration.
